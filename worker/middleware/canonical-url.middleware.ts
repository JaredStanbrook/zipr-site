/**
 * One address per page, enforced before anything renders.
 *
 * - **HTTP → HTTPS.** Cloudflare answers plain `http://` on the custom domain
 *   with a 200 unless the zone's "Always Use HTTPS" is on, which left every
 *   page reachable at two addresses. Scoped to ORIGIN's host, so
 *   `*.workers.dev` previews are untouched. HSTS then tells browsers to skip
 *   the HTTP hop from the first visit on.
 *
 *   The scheme comes from Cloudflare's `CF-Visitor` header, not from the
 *   request URL. `wrangler dev` rewrites the URL to the production host while
 *   serving plain HTTP on localhost, so trusting the URL redirected a local
 *   preview to itself forever. The edge always sets `CF-Visitor`; nothing
 *   local does, so without it this does nothing rather than loop.
 * - **`/features/` → `/features`.** Routes are declared without a trailing
 *   slash, so the slashed form was a 404 for anyone who typed or linked it
 *   that way. GET and HEAD only: a redirected POST would lose its body.
 *
 * Both are 301s — the moves are permanent, and a permanent redirect is what
 * passes a link's value on to the canonical URL.
