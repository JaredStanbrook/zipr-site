-- Data backfill, hand-added: drizzle-kit generates schema changes, and this is
-- a change to the rows. It alters no structure, so the 0006 snapshot stays
-- accurate and the next `npm run gen` still diffs cleanly.
--
-- Emails are stored lowercased from here on (see users.email). Existing rows
-- have to be brought in line or the same account exists twice, once per
-- capitalisation. Rows whose lowercase form is already taken are left exactly
-- as they are: that is two real accounts for one mailbox, and merging them is
-- a decision about whose data survives, not something a migration should
-- silently make. They keep working; the site owner can reconcile them.
