description: Build, configure and style apps on the Frugal Cloudflare Workers template (Hono + server-rendered JSX + HTMX + D1/Drizzle, Tailwind theme tokens). Use this skill for BOTH jobs it covers. First, turning a fresh copy of the template into a real site — trigger on "I want to build X with this", "set up this repo", "new site from this template", a pasted app brief, or any mention of wiring D1, KV or R2. Second, all ongoing work — adding a page, route, form, table, migration, nav link, auth or permission rule, and every visual or CSS change however small ("restyle this", "change the colours", "make it look better", "add a dashboard", dark mode). It covers the exact template-to-app procedure, how to wire each binding, the frontend/backend split, the registration steps a feature needs in order to be reachable, and the theme-token rules that keep light and dark working — all easy to miss and tedious to debug afterwards.

# Building on the Frugal template

A single Cloudflare Worker that server-renders every page. Hono routes it, JSX
renders it, HTMX swaps fragments, D1 + Drizzle store it, and Tailwind theme
tokens style it. There is no separate frontend app to deploy and no client
router — the server is the application.

Read `architecture.md` in the repo root for the request lifecycle. This skill
is about _how to add to it_ without breaking the parts that are already right.

## First: is this still the template?

Check before doing anything else, because the answer changes what you do:

```bash
grep -in "change.me\|0000000\|frug-app" wrangler.jsonc | grep -v ":\s*//"
```

**Any hit outside a comment** means this repo has never been configured. Do not
start writing features — read `references/new-site.md` and follow it from the
top. It covers getting a brief, choosing which of D1/KV/R2 the app needs,
configuring the repo, modelling the domain in one migration, and stripping the
example feature. Skipping it produces an app that builds locally and cannot
deploy, because its bindings point at placeholders.

**No hits** means this is a real site. Carry on with the rest of this file.

One thing that holds in both cases: **never configure the template repository
itself.** Real ids belong in the repo made *from* the template. A configured
template hands the next site someone else's database, and its first deploy
migrates live data. If you find real ids in a repo that is meant to be the
template, say so rather than building on it.

## Four things that matter most

These are the mistakes that cost the most time, in order:

1. **Style with theme tokens, never raw colours.** `bg-card`, not
   `bg-white`. A raw colour looks fine in whichever mode you happened to
   test and is unreadable in the other. See "Styling" below — this is
   non-negotiable in a way the other rules are not, because it silently
   produces broken output rather than an error.
2. **A new feature has to be registered in several places** or it renders
   but is unreachable. See the checklist below.
3. **Scope every query by owner** in the `where` clause, not in a check
   afterwards. An unauthorised row should never be loaded.
4. **Run `npm run build` before you finish.** It generates types, typechecks
   and bundles. It catches the class of error — a view importing something a
   route no longer passes — that this architecture makes easy to create.

## The split

**Backend — runs in the Worker:**

| Path                 | Holds                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `worker/index.ts`    | Entry: CORS, global middleware, error handling                 |
| `worker/app.tsx`     | The router. Feature routers are mounted here                   |
| `worker/routes/`     | Route handlers, grouped `web/` `api/` `admin/` + feature files |
| `worker/services/`   | Business logic worth testing on its own                        |
| `worker/schema/`     | Drizzle tables + the Zod validators derived from them          |
| `worker/middleware/` | config, db, auth, guards, the SSR renderer                     |
| `worker/config/`     | `app.config.ts` (branding), `auth.config.ts` (auth + RBAC)     |
| `worker/lib/`        | crypto, `htmx-helpers`, formatting                             |

**Frontend — two different things, don't confuse them:**

| Path                 | Runs                                      | Use for                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `worker/views/`      | **On the server.** Hono JSX → HTML string | Every page and fragment. No `useState`, no browser APIs, no data fetching — pure functions of props        |
| `worker/components/` | **In the browser.** Lit custom elements   | Only what the server genuinely cannot do: WebAuthn ceremonies, theme persistence, modal open/close, toasts |

Default to `views/`. Reach for `components/` only when you catch yourself
needing browser state — this is a server-rendered app and keeping it that way
is what makes it fast and simple.

Aliases: `@server/*` → `worker/*`, `@views/*` → `worker/views/*`,
`@components/*` → `worker/components/*`.

## Styling

The theme is a set of semantic CSS variables defined in `worker/index.css`,
mapped to Tailwind utilities via `@theme inline`. Light lives on `:root`, dark
on `.dark`, and `<theme-provider>` toggles the class before first paint.

**Use the semantic token, not the colour you have in mind.** Every token has a
light and a dark value, so token-styled UI adapts for free. A hardcoded colour
does not, and nothing will warn you.

| Need               | Use                                            | Never                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Page background    | `bg-background`                                | `bg-white`, `bg-gray-50`, `bg-slate-900` |
| Body text          | `text-foreground`                              | `text-black`, `text-gray-900`            |
| Panel / card       | `bg-card text-card-foreground`                 | `bg-white shadow`                        |
| Secondary text     | `text-muted-foreground`                        | `text-gray-500`                          |
| Subtle fill        | `bg-muted`                                     | `bg-gray-100`                            |
| Main action        | `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`           | `bg-blue-600 text-white`                 |
| Hover / highlight  | `hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground` | `hover:bg-gray-100`                      |
| Delete / error     | `text-destructive`, `hover:bg-destructive/10`  | `text-red-600`                           |
| Borders            | `border-border`, `border-input`                | `border-gray-200`                        |
| Focus ring         | `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring`                 | `focus:ring-blue-500`                    |
| Popover / dropdown | `bg-popover text-popover-foreground`           | `bg-white`                               |
| Chart series       | `text-chart-1` … `chart-5`                     | arbitrary hexes                          |

Opacity modifiers on tokens are encouraged — `bg-primary/10`, `bg-accent/50`,
`border-destructive/20` — they stay theme-correct.

`rounded-lg` is the house default; `radius`, fonts and shadows are tokens too
(`shadow-sm`, `font-sans`). Only add a new token if a genuinely new semantic
role appears, and add it to `:root`, `.dark` **and** `@theme inline` together —
a token missing from any one of the three breaks that mode.

To restyle the whole app, change the values in `worker/index.css`. Do not
sprinkle overrides through components. Full detail, including how to add a
third theme: `references/styling.md`.

## Adding a feature

`worker/schema/note.schema.ts`, `worker/routes/notes.tsx` and
`worker/views/notes/` are a complete worked example — schema, validation,
guarded routes, ownership checks, HTMX fragments, soft deletes. **Read those
three files before writing a new feature** and copy their shape; it is faster
and more consistent than inventing one.

1. **Schema** — `worker/schema/<feature>.schema.ts`. Drizzle table, spread
   `ownershipColumns` for `userId` + timestamps, add `deletedAt` for soft
   deletes, derive Zod schemas with `drizzle-zod`, export the inferred types.
2. **Migration** — `npm run gen`. Never hand-edit files in `drizzle/`.
3. **Views** — `worker/views/<feature>/`. Pure functions of props. Give every
   fragment HTMX can target a stable `id`.
4. **Route** — `worker/routes/<feature>.tsx`. Guard, validate, authorise,
   respond.
5. **Register it** — see below.
6. **Verify** — `npm run build && npm run test`.

### Registration checklist

A feature that renders but is invisible is almost always a missed line here:

- [ ] `worker/app.tsx` — mount the router (`.route("/things", thingsRoute)`)
- [ ] `worker/views/components/NavBar.tsx` — add to `menuConfig` under each
      role that should see it, or there is no way to navigate to it
- [ ] `wrangler.jsonc` — add permission strings to `PERMISSIONS_AVAILABLE`
      and grant them in `ROLES_INHERENT`
- [ ] `worker/services/access.service.ts` — add the resource to the
      `Resource` union, or `authorize()` will not typecheck
- [ ] `worker/routes/dev.tsx` — add the table so it shows in the inspector
- [ ] `tests/ui-pages.test.ts` — add the new paths
- [ ] Client-side element? Import it in `worker/components/main.ts` or it
      never registers

### Routes

```tsx
export const thingsRoute = new Hono<AppEnv>();
thingsRoute.use("*", requireUser); // guards the whole router

thingsRoute.get("/", async (c) => {
  const user = c.var.auth.user!;
  access.authorize(user, "things", "read");

  const things = await c.var.db
    .select()
    .from(thing)
    .where(and(eq(thing.userId, user.id), isNull(thing.deletedAt)));

  return htmxResponse(c, "Things", <ThingListPage things={things} />);
});
```

`htmxResponse(c, title, fragment)` returns the bare fragment to an HTMX
request and the full page otherwise, so one handler serves a swap, a refresh
and a shared link.

Two authorisation layers, answering different questions: guards
(`requireUser`, `requireRole`, `requirePermission`) decide whether the user
reaches the router at all; `AccessControl.authorize(user, resource, action,
ownerId?)` decides whether they may touch a specific row.

Feedback: `htmxToast(c, msg)` when the response itself renders,
`flashToast(c, msg)` when you are about to `c.redirect(...)` — it survives the
navigation. Available in `c.var`: `db`, `auth`, `app` (branding/locale),
`authConfig`.

More in `references/backend.md` and the repo's `endpoints.md`.

## Conventions worth keeping

- **Money is integer cents.** Convert at the edges with `dollarsToCents` and
  `formatCents`; never do float arithmetic on money.
- **Soft delete** — set `deletedAt`, filter with `isNull(...)`, so history
  survives.
- **Never return a raw `users` row.** `Auth.toSafeUser()` strips
  `passwordHash`, `pin` and `totpSecret`. Every exit from the auth service
  goes through it.
- **Locale and currency come from `c.var.app`**, not hardcoded — the
  formatters in `worker/views/lib/utils.ts` take them as arguments.
- Match the surrounding code's comment density and naming. Explain _why_ in
  comments, not _what_.

## Verifying

```bash
npm run build     # wrangler types → tsc → client + server bundles
npm run test      # route smoke tests, signed out and signed in
npm run lint
npm run format:write
```

In a web session the SessionStart hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`) has
already run `npm install` and `wrangler types`, so the build works immediately.
Locally, run those once yourself.

To see it running: `npm run migrate:local` once, then `npm run dev` on
:3000 (`.dev.vars` needs `JWT_SECRET`; set `RP_ID=localhost` and
`ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000` there for passkeys).

## Shipping

Cloudflare's Git integration builds and deploys on every push — there is no
deploy command anyone runs. Push, then watch **Settings → Builds**.

Schema changes deploy themselves: `npm run deploy` (the dashboard's Deploy
command) applies migrations immediately before the new code goes live. D1
migrations are forward-only, so a destructive change needs a forward fix
rather than a rollback. `docs/deploy.md` covers setup, failures and rollback.

## Reference files

- `references/new-site.md` — **read this first if the repo is still the
  template.** The ordered procedure from fresh copy to working app.
- `references/bindings.md` — D1, KV and R2: which to use for what, how to wire,
  remove or add each, and how to verify before deploying.
- `references/styling.md` — the theme system in depth: every token and its
  role, adding a theme, component patterns, dark-mode pitfalls.
- `references/backend.md` — schema, validation, services, auth, RBAC, HTMX
  response patterns, testing.
- `references/frontend.md` — server views vs client islands, HTMX attributes,
  when a Lit component is justified and how to write one.
